# Visual Regression - WebdriverCSS + WebdriverIO (Selenium)

This is basically a small POC using the OS services to handle automation testing for visual regression.

Use following command for downloading dependencies:
```sh
$ npm install
```

## To run a test you must have selenium server running.
Open different terminal and run following commands to install + start selenium server.
```sh
$ npm install selenium-standalone@latest -g
$ selenium-standalone install
$ selenium-standalone start
```

## Run a test
I have included a sample file to run the test 
[webdriver.js](https://github.com/designerdevil/visualregression/blob/master/webdriver.js)

Simple run following command for test:
```sh
$ node webdriver.js
```


Thats it Enjoy!!!
